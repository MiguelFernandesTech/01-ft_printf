# 01-ft_printf
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. Recode printf(). 


-> The ft_printf project is a programming exercise aimed at recreating the functionality of the printf function found in the C standard library. The project requires the implementation of a new function called ft_printf, which takes a string as its first argument and a variable number of arguments that will be printed in accordance with the formatting directives specified in the string. The purpose of the project is to gain experience with variable argument lists and to better understand how printf works under the hood.

-> In the project, the following conversions must be implemented: %c (prints a single character), %s (prints a string), %p (prints a pointer in hexadecimal format), %d (prints a decimal number), %i (prints an integer), %u (prints an unsigned decimal number), %x (prints a number in lowercase hexadecimal format), %X (prints a number in uppercase hexadecimal format), and %% (prints a percent sign). The resulting function should handle these conversions in a manner that is comparable to the original printf function.

-> Overall, the project provides an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of a commonly used library function while also honing important programming skills.
